# Analytical Workflows Teaching Materials

This repo contains the teaching materials for IB599 Analytical Workflows taught at Oregon State University.  

_More precisely, it *will soon* contain the *updated* materials (i.e. this repo is under construction!)._  _Until that time it will primarily contain the materials from 2019, the first and last time this course was run._


The most relevant folders are:
- [course_info](course_info/) containing grading [rubrics](course_info/rubrics/) and the [course syllabus](course_info/syllabus/);
- [classes](classes/) containing a folder for each course topic;
- [readings](readings/) containing pdfs of each topic's readings.

Most of the [classes](classes/) folders contain LaTeX versions of our lecture notes. You can compile the *.tex file yourself, or just look for the associated *.pdf file.
