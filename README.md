# Analytical Workflows

This repo contains the materials for _IB 516 Analytical Workflows_ co-developed by [Mark Novak](https://novaklabosu.github.io) and [Ben Dalziel](https://ib.oregonstate.edu/directory/benjamin-d-dalziel) at Oregon State University.

The repository's most relevant folders are:
- [course_info](course_info/) -  grading [rubrics](course_info/rubrics/) and the [course syllabus](course_info/syllabus/syllabus.pdf);
- [classes](classes/) - sub-folders for each course topic;
- [readings](readings/) - pdfs of the required and suggested readings.

## Course Description
Have you proposed a modeling chapter for your dissertation but need support getting things up and
running?
Are you sitting on a data set ready for analysis and visualization but don't know how or
where to begin?
Maybe you're far along in some series of analyses and feel ``lost in the trees.''

This course will help you with these challenges by practicing the development and implementation of
efficient, reproducible *workflows* for your projects.
Every project should (and can) be modular and fully automated, hence reproducible, portable and
easily modified.
Rerunning a model under a different set of parameters should (and can) be as simple as a few
keystrokes.
Regenerating all analyses, figures and tables after finding a typo in your code or dataset should (and
can) be painless.

Efficient workflows start at project conception and end only if the project idea is itself a dead end.
Thus, in this course, we'll work to practice
(1) refining and articulating project ideas and goals,
(2) creating modular and automated analyses, and
(3) using best-practices in coding and project management.
We'll learn how to use Git, GitHub, LaTeX, and Markdown.
I will mostly use R within RStudio, but users of other programming languages
and text editors are welcome and encouraged.
You will need either
(1) a large dataset
or
(2) a dynamical model or simulation.
For either, you'll need to have a goal and a well-developed vision for achieving it.
(We won't be learning statistics or mathematics.)
The use of other people's data or published models is acceptable, but working on your own thesis work / projects is strongly encouraged.

## Broken links, Questions, Suggestions
If you find a broken link or typo, please create an _Issue_ to let me know where it is!
You can also create an _Issue_ to leave feedback, pose questions, or suggest new or alternative materials (e.g., new publications) to include.
You can also write to me at [mark.novak@oregonstate.edu](mailto:mark.novak@oregonstate.edu).
