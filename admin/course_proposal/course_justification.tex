\section*{Course Motivation}
Graduate students are amassing ever larger datasets to ask ever more challenging questions with ever 
more sophisticated  statistical techniques. 
Many others propose dissertation chapters entailing computationally demanding simulations or the 
analysis of parameter-rich mathematical models. 
Keeping pace in their field often requires students to straddle empirical, statistical and theoretical 
techniques. 
These multi-faceted and ever more collaborative approaches lie at the heart of our 
department's \emph{integrative} approach to biology and have become standard practice in many of the 
career paths our students pursue.
And yet, nowhere in our curriculum are students provided the opportunity to learn the skills, basic tools 
and best practices with which to manage the complexity of their projects.
This poses a non-trivial challenge to our students that is fundamentally distinct from the learning of 
specific content, methods or platforms.

Our course provides students the skills and tools they need to organize and manage their projects from 
inception to publication.  
Working with their own data or models, students learn and practice: (re)organizing projects into 
efficient, reproducible and easily-modified ``\emph{analytical workflows}''; 
writing modular, transparent computer code in the programming language of their choice;
and tracking and communicating progress and hurdles to others using stand-alone and cloud-based 
version control and collaboration software.
Although these have proven to be game-changing for graduate students at all levels, the 
target audience for this course is students who have substantial data in hand or have an 
implementable framework for their analyses established (i.e. $2^{nd}$ to $4^{th}$ year Ph.D. and 
$2^{nd}$ to $5^{th}$ term M.S. students).


\section*{Related Courses at OSU}
OSU's relevant statistics courses focus exclusively on data visualization.
Existing omics and informatics courses introduce students to specific analysis 
pipelines in particular programming environments and do not address issues relating to project 
management as a whole.
Existing courses are also not relevant to the many IB students pursuing non-\emph{omic} research.

\section*{Student Testimonials}
We have taught two prior IB 599 versions of this course: Spring 2019 (2 \emph{cr.}) \& Fall 2020 (4 
\emph{cr.}).
Students ranged from $1^{st}$ year M.S. to $5^{th}$ year Ph.D. from across three colleges. 
Student eSET scores were 6.0 and 6.0 in 2019 and 5.8 and 5.8 in 2020 for ``the course as a whole'' and 
``the instructor's contribution'' respectively\footnote{By contrast, the department's median scores were 
4.9 and 5.1 in Spring 2019, and 5.1 and 5.4 in Fall 2020, out of 6.0 points possible.}.


The following are excerpts of the feedback that was received via email and the eSET evaluations.

\begin{quote}
	\emph{I am of the opinion that this Analytical Workflow class is indispensable. Engaging in research 
	comes with a massive deluge of papers, files, data, output, etc, and yet prior to this class I had never 
	before been exposed to organizational best practices recommendations.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
	\emph{I started this course with nothing but raw data and anxiety, and I am leaving with code that 
		works, a reproducible workflow, and the confidence and resources to press on.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
	\emph{I'm so happy this class exists, and it was instrumental to much of the progress I've made this 
	term.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
\emph{Ben and Mark helped turn a daunting task that I'd been putting off [...] into a 
well-organized reality! Five stars.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
	\emph{This class has been extremely useful for the conceptual organization and technical execution 
	of my research. Thank you for organizing and leading this class!}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
	\emph{Who should take this course?  Anyone working on a project that uses coding or modeling.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
	\emph{I really appreciate that you shared your experience and learning process with us (metacognitive 
		reflection! best teaching practices!).}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
	\emph{After taking the class, [...] I feel empowered to solve issues with my model on my own.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
	\emph{It was reassuring and encouraging to be able to share feelings and experiences with my 
	colleagues and have them validated, listen to their counsel, and know that I am not the only one 
	facing these challenges.}
