## Class notes

### Introduction
#### 2020Fall
Required entire time period (w/ 5 min. break) but didn't have time for actually doing the app installations or starting on proposals.
Took 70 min to get to end of class schedule (though could be done more efficiently).
Probably spent only 5 min. in discussion/answering questions.

#### Post first day (Canvas) announcement text:
Hi everyone,

I probably won't do this regularly down the road, but because of how much information I gave you today I figure it'd be helpful to summarize your to-do's.

- Apps & Accounts (for Tuesday)
  - Create a GitHub account (and send me your username)
  - Install Git and LaTex
  - Pick and install a Git GUI
  - Decide whether to use a browser-based or stand-alone text-editor (primarily for LaTex, but also relevant to Markdown), and either create an account or install.
- Discord
  - Create account (and install)
  - I will send-out an invite to join tomorrow (Friday) morning.  You will have 48 hrs to join.  (The invitation will have installation details too.)
- Readings (for Tuesday)
  - The paper assigned for today
  - My notes for Structured Projects
  - My notes for Git w/ GitHub
  - The "Getting Started w/ Git"
- Project Proposal (for Thursday)
  - Start planning & putting together your presentation
  - see README for details and additional before-class to-do's

Finally, please email me if you'd like to discuss your project idea before committing to something.

I think that's it.
