## Things to Post


#### _First day:_

Hi everyone,

I probably won't do this regularly down the road, but because of how much information I gave you today I figure it'd be helpful to summarize your to-do's.

- Apps & Accounts (for Tuesday)
  - Create a GitHub account (and send me your username)
  - Install Git and LaTex
  - Pick and install a Git GUI
  - Decide whether to use a browser-based or stand-alone text-editor (primarily for LaTex, but also relevant to Markdown), and either create an account or install.
- Discord
  - Create account (and install)
  - I will send-out an invite to join tomorrow (Friday) morning.  You will have 48 hrs to join.  (The invitation will have installation details too.)
- Readings (for Tuesday)
  - The paper assigned for today
  - My notes for Structured Projects
  - My notes for Git w/ GitHub
  - The "Getting Started w/ Git"
- Project Proposal (for Thursday)
  - Start planning & putting together your presentation
  - see README for details and additional before-class to-do's

Finally, please email me if you'd like to discuss your project idea before committing to something.

I think that's it.

#### _Week 2 - Before Project Proposal presentations:_

Post text for [What to do with an idea](../classes/ProjectProposal/notes/What_to_do_with_an_idea.md)


#### _Week 3 - Before Visualization in Wk 5_

In our upcoming class on _Data Visualization_, I'd like for us to critique (not necessary criticize) published figures from the literature to see what aspects of data visualization can work well and what often doesn't.  As fodder for our discussion, please submit to me a copy of each of the following by the end of week 4 (via email is fine):

1) A figure _that you really like_;
2) A figure _that you think could present the data (or the main message of the paper) better_.

The figures can be old or new (i.e. it doesn't matter what year they were published), simple or complex, single- or multi-panelled, etc.  The only real requirement is that they depict data or their quantitative summary (i.e. are not conceptual figures or the like).

P.S. Feel free to submit any additional figures to share beyond those two, if you'd like.

## Class notes

***

### Introduction
#### _2020Fall_
Required entire time period (w/ 5 min. break) but didn't have time for actually doing the app installations or starting on proposals.
Took 70 min to get to end of class schedule (though could be done more efficiently).
Probably spent only 5 min. in discussion/answering questions.

***

### Intro2Git
#### _2020Fall_
Project structure took ~65 minutes! (I talked too much). Hence Intro2Git was rushed.
Everyone using either RStudio or SourceTree, hence showed cloning in both (but rushed).
Didn't leave enough time to talk about Git workflow, or about how to write "informative" commit messages.

***
### Project presentations
#### _2020Fall_
Technical challenges:
 - Bandwidth (turning off all videos seemed to help)
 - "Presentation mode" did not work for anyone.  (Discord stays on main app screen.)  Need to just present in main app screen.
 - One student had flashing screen (display frequency issue?)

Most students took ~8-9 minutes.
Need to clarify expectation for "Project goals" to be less about science and more about implementation goals.
