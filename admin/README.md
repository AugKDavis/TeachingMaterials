# Things to post or do



#### _Week 0 email_

Hi everyone,

Welcome to the first week of Analytical Workflows (IB 516)!

Overall, this class is about designing and building good analyses for scientific research. 
You will work on your own research with whatever scientific approach makes sense for your work and in whatever programming language(s) you choose. 
Overarching the specifics are a set of best practices that should help make your science more effective, reproducible, and ultimately faster and more fun. 
These best practices are always evolving and there is always more to be learned.
I love 'teaching' this class because I get to learn alongside you!

Here are a few notes prior to the first class:

* This class is BYO-research. Please arrive to the first class of the term knowing which of your thesis chapters / research projects you will work on during the course. If you are unsure, I suggest discussing with your thesis advisor. I am also happy to think through it with you. Whatever chapter/topic you choose, the goal is that you will (by the end of the term) have designed and built an efficient and well-managed workflow for that chapter/project. 

* Please bring a laptop if you have one. If you don't have one, please let me know. I'll help you find one for use during class time.

I'm looking forward to working with you this term!

#### _First day:_

Hi everyone,

I probably won't do this regularly down the road, but because of how much information I gave you today I figure it'd be helpful to summarize your to-do's.

- Apps & Accounts (for next class)
  - Create a GitHub account (and send me your username)
  - Install Git and LaTex
  - Pick and install a Git GUI
  - Decide whether to use a browser-based or stand-alone text-editor (primarily for LaTex, but also relevant to Markdown), and either create an account or install.

- Readings (for next class)
  - The paper assigned for today (if you haven't read it already)
  - My notes for Structured Projects
  - My notes for Git w/ GitHub
  - The "Getting Started w/ Git"

- Project Proposal (for the class after next)
  - Start planning & putting together your presentation
  - see README for details and additional before-class to-do's

Finally, please email me if you'd like to discuss your project idea before committing to something.

#### _Week 2 - Before Project Proposal presentations:_

- Post text for [What to do with an idea](../classes/ProjectProposal/notes/What_to_do_with_an_idea.md)
- Fork everyone's repo to the organization (to enable use of Issue for peer feedback, while not having that feedback be a part of what could end up being a permanent and public repository. (Forks will be deleted at the end of the class).)


#### _Week 3 - Before Visualization in Wk 5_

In our upcoming class on _Data Visualization_, I'd like for us to critique (not necessary criticize) published figures from the literature to see what aspects of data visualization can work well and what often doesn't.  As fodder for our discussion, please submit to me a copy of each of the following by the end of week 4 (via email is fine):

1) A figure _that you really like_;
2) A figure _that you think could present the data (or the main message of the paper) better_.

The figures can be old or new (i.e. it doesn't matter what year they were published), simple or complex, single- or multi-paneled, etc.  The only real requirement is that they depict data or their quantitative summary (i.e. are not conceptual figures or the like).

P.S. Feel free to submit any additional figures to share beyond those two, if you'd like.
