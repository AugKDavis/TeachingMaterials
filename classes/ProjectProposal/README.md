# Progress Proposals

Our primary goal in this course is for you to develop more efficient research skills.  An important secondary goal is to have you make significant progress on your thesis!  Our philosophy is that our primary goal will be best achieved by having you practice new tools while working on your own research (rather than on homework assignments, for example).

In order for us _and your classmates_ to support and help you, we need to know what your goals are for the quarter.  Hence these "Project Proposals".

### Required readings (_before class_)
_None_

### To do (_before class_)
- create a new _Issue_ on your GitHub repo page titled _Project proposal_.
- create a slide presentation (PowerPoint, Keynote, whatever) to present (_by sharing your screen_).  _No more than **5 slides** (including title slide)!_

### Class structure
We'll dedicate the whole class period to presentations.

**Each presenter** will have **_6 minutes_** to:
1. summarize your background (e.g., prior experiences, reason for being in course);
2. summarize your project (i.e. the scientific issue being addresses);
3. summarize your project goals for the quarter;
4. summarize your anticipated challenges.

In putting your presentation together, think hard about your audience and what it is we need to (and don't necessarily need to) know.  Don't shy away from important or useful ideas, but also don't distract us from them.  Communication skills are (increasingly) key to being a successful scientist ([Hampton et al. 2017](../../readings/pdfs/Hampton2017.pdf)).

**All observers** must go to the presenter's GitHub repo and add to the _Project proposal_ issue as a comment:
1. one (or more) compliments;
2. a suggestion, of any form (_optional_).

### Rubric
The rubric with which your presentation will be assessed is [here](../../course_info/rubrics/).
