# Project Proposals

Our primary goal in this course is for you to develop more efficient research skills.  An important secondary goal is to have you make significant progress on your thesis!  Our philosophy is that we can achieve both because our primary goal will be best achieved by having you practice new tools while working on your own research (rather than on homework assignments, for example).

In order for us _and your classmates_ to support and help you, we need to know what your goals are for the quarter.  Hence these "Project Proposals".

### Required readings (_before class_)
_None_

### To do (_before class_)
- Send me a link to your repo.  (I will "fork" it -- make a copy of it -- on our AnalyticalWorkflow organization.)
- Create a new _Issue_ (on the _forked_ copy of your repo) page titled _Project proposal_.
- Create a slide presentation (PowerPoint, Keynote, whatever) to present.  _No more than **5 slides** (including title slide)!_

### Class structure
We'll dedicate the whole class period to presentations.

**Each presenter** will have **_6 minutes_** to:
1. summarize your background (e.g., prior experiences, reason for being in course);
2. summarize your project (i.e. the scientific issue being addressed);
3. summarize your project goals for the quarter (your 'coding' rather than scientific goals);
4. summarize your anticipated challenges.

In putting your presentation together, think hard about your audience and what it is we need to (and don't necessarily need to) know.  Don't shy away from important or useful ideas, but also don't distract us from them.  Communication skills are (increasingly) key to being a successful scientist.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

**All observers** must go to the presenter's _forked_ repo (on the AnalyticalWorkflow organization) and add to the _Project proposal_ issue as a comment:
1. one (or more) compliments;
2. a suggestion, of any form (_optional_).

### Rubric
The rubric with which your presentation will be assessed is [here](../../course_info/rubrics/).

<b id="f1">1.</b> "Effective communication both within a collaborative team and to the broader scientific and nonscientific community is a critical skill in science. In both cases, researchers who are effective communicators learn to invest time and energy in understanding their audience—whether it is a research team or a policy-setting organization—and honing their skills to engage in a meaningful, respectful and productive dialogue."
