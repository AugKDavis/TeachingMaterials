### Figure checklist

- [ ] Axes label font is large enough to easily read at a distance
- [ ] Axis labels are specific and include units whenever appropriate 
- [ ] Axes range is appropriate
- [ ] If multiple panels are present, axes ranges are identical for the same variable unless clearly flagged and justified
- [ ] Color schemes are maintained across panels and figures, as much as possible
- [ ] Plots are accessible to folks who percieve colour differently 
- [ ] Color ramps (e.g. heatmaps) colors are intuitive (e.g., blue for cool, red for hot)
- [ ] For maps: appropriate spatial orientation: scale, possibly north arrow, etc. 
- [ ] Legend, if appropriate/helpful
- [ ] Legend position does not interfere with figure (and in consistent position across figures where practical)
- [ ] Consider redundancy of information between legend and caption
- [ ] Picture of the biology (creatures, or morphology, or study site, etc.) if useful
- [ ] Are the key messages of the paper also the perceptual comparisons that are easiest to make in the figure
- [ ] Don't ever stick with "factory settings" for a figure (either in base R or ggplot or whatever)
