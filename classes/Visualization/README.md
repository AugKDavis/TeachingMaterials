# Data Visualization
In this class we'll discuss data visualization and the workflow(s) with which to perform it.  We'll also critique (not criticize) published figures from the published literature to discuss what aspects of data visualization can work well and what often doesn't.

### Required readings (_before class_)
- Notes: [Rmd/visualization_part_1.pdf](Rmd/visualization_part_1.pdf)
- [Kelleher et al. 2011. Ten guidelines for effective data visualization in scientific publications](../../readings/pdfs/Kelleher2011.pdf)
- [Weissgerber et al. 2019. Reveal, Donâ€™t Conceal. Transforming Data Visualization to Improve Transparency](../../readings/pdfs/Weissgerber2019.pdf)

### To do (_before class_)
Please submit (via email) a copy of each of the following:
1. A figure _that you really like_;
2. A figure _that you think could present the data (or the main message of the paper) better_.

The figures can be new or ancient (i.e. it doesn't matter what year they were published), simple or complex, single- or multi-paneled, etc.  The only real requirement is that they depict data or their quantitative summary (i.e. are not conceptual figures or the like).

(Feel free to submit any additional figures to share beyond those two, if you'd like.)

### Class structure
