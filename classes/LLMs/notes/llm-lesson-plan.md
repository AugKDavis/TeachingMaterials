# Large Language Models in Scientific Applications
**Course Duration:** 110 minutes
**Target Audience:** Graduate students without prior LLM/CS background
**Learning Objectives:** Understanding LLM fundamentals and practical applications in scientific research

## Part 1: LLM Fundamentals (45 minutes)

### 1. Introduction to LLMs (10 minutes)
- Brief history of AI development
- Distinction between Machine Learning and Deep Learning
  - Machine Learning: Algorithms that learn from data without explicit programming
  - Deep Learning: Subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers

### 2. Core LLM Concepts (20 minutes)

#### Tokens and Embeddings
- Tokens: Basic units of text processing
  - Example: "cinematography" → ["cinema", "tography"]
- Word embeddings: Converting words to numerical vectors
  - Demonstration: Similar words cluster together in vector space
  - Example: "king" - "man" + "woman" ≈ "queen"

#### Transformer Architecture
- Key components: attention mechanisms, encoders, decoders
- How transformers process sequential data
- Role of context windows

#### Training Processes
- Pre-training: Learning language patterns from vast datasets
- Fine-tuning: Specializing for specific tasks
- Reinforcement Learning: Improving outputs based on feedback
  - Example: ChatGPT's use of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

### 3. Interactive Discussion (15 minutes)
- Q&A session
- Common misconceptions about LLMs
- Current limitations and ethical considerations

## Part 2: Practical Applications (65 minutes)

### 1. Effective Prompting Techniques (15 minutes)

#### Key Principles
- Be specific and detailed
- Provide context and examples
- Use step-by-step instructions
- Include format specifications
- Request explanations when needed

#### Example Structure:
```
Role: Specify the role you want the LLM to assume
Context: Provide relevant background information
Task: Clearly state what you want the LLM to do
Format: Specify how you want the output structured
Additional Requirements: Any constraints or preferences
```

### 2. Application Demonstrations (50 minutes)

#### A. R Programming Assistant (15 minutes)

Example Prompt for Code Generation:
```
Role: You are an expert R programmer assisting with data analysis.
Context: I am working with ecological data stored in a CSV file.
Task: Please write R code to:
1. Read a CSV file named 'species_data.csv'
2. Clean the data by removing NA values
3. Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between predator size and prey size
4. Add a trend line to the plot
Format: Provide the code with comments explaining each step
Additional: Include error handling and basic data validation
```

#### B. Literature Classification (20 minutes)

Example Prompt for PDF Classification:
```
Role: You are a research assistant analyzing scientific papers.
Context: I need to identify papers that discuss predator-prey dietary relationships.
Task: For each PDF in the provided set:
1. Extract and analyze the main content
2. Determine if it contains information about predator diet or feeding behavior
3. Classify as either relevant or non-relevant
4. Provide a brief justification for the classification
Format: Create a table with columns for:
- Paper title
- Classification (relevant/non-relevant)
- Justification
- Confidence level (high/medium/low)
Additional: Flag any papers that mention predator-prey relationships but don't focus on diet
```

#### C. Scientific Visualization (15 minutes)

Example Prompt for Food Web Generation:
```
Role: You are a scientific illustrator specializing in ecological networks.
Context: I need to create a food web diagram showing predator-prey relationships.
Task: Create an SVG image that:
1. Shows the following species pairs as nodes:
   [List species pairs here]
2. Connect predators to their prey with arrows
3. Use different node sizes based on trophic level
Format: Generate an SVG with:
- Circular nodes for species
- Directed edges showing feeding relationships
- Clear labels for each species
- Legend explaining the visualization
Additional: Use a color scheme suitable for colorblind viewers
```
