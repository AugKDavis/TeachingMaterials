# Large Language Models
Many consider LLMs to work as sort of co-intelligence, augmenting and potentially even replacing human thinking.

We will forgo discussions pertaining to teaching.  Instead, we'll limit our perspective to our own training as ever-learning scientists.

It's a brave new world out there, so let's talk about it.

### Required readings (_before class_)


### To do (_before class_)


### Class structure
#### What are we even talking about?
AI vs. ML vs. LLMs vs. Foundation models

#### Our focus: LLMs / Foundation models
- What can they do?
- How are they built (what are their components)?
- What do they do?
- How do (we think) they do it?


#### Applications
- Coding
- Writing
- Literature review
- Paper summaries
- Image generation (for talks)
- Data generation (document 
- Data imputation and prediction


## Considerations
- Crutch vs. tool (efficiency, creativity, ...)
- Scientific ethics
- Environmental impacts
