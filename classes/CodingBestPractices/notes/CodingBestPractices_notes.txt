Today: Best Practices

Writing clean and clear will help others and you.
	- You will spend most of your time de-bugging rather than writing
	- Good code is less error-prone
	- Good code will (eventually) be faster to write
	- Good code will help you be more creative

Principles: Good code is
	- hierarchically-modular
	- readable

Project modularity
	- Project mindset
		- data
			- raw
			- clean
			- meta-data
		- R code
			- data_prep.R
			- functions.R (library)
			- analyses.R
			- final_figs.R
		- results

	Absolute vs. relative paths
		Mac (Unix) vs. Windows (Dos)
		Is it worth trying this out together?  
		If so		create .txt file in a data folder
			 	use read.table() from within a code folder to access it

Start fresh each time

Within-script structure
	See R/simulateLV.R in Sandbox Repo

Functions
	Don't-Repeat-Yourself  (not DIY)
	Unit testing

Readable code
	Go to https://style.tidyverse.org to highlight the following:
		- File and Object names
		- Control flow
		- Long lines
