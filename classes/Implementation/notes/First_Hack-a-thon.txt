Thoughts or Questions about last time?

Today: 
- practice using Git & make progress on projects
	- project set-up
	- workflow diagram(s)
	- coding (but not reading or research on analyses, etc., rather: doing)
- last 10 minutes to check-in with accountabilibuddy
	- come prepared with accomplishments and goals for next 7 days

Discord
- Goal is to replicate the in-classroom experience as much as possible
	comes with potential distractions, but also spontaneous learning opportunities
- you've got ample opportunity to isolate
- try stick to Main classroom or Library
- try to leave video on

Today will inevitably set the stage for subsequent hack-a-thon sessions, so strongly encourage dialogue and discussion.
Agree as a group that talking is not rude or intrusive!

Since this is our first Hack-a-thon, consider me (and others) like a consultant on your project workflow.
Because I suspect the remote format is biased against sharing, I may also ask individuals (or pairs) to go to a side-channel and share with me where they're currently at in their thinking.
