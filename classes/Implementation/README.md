# Implementation & Team troubleshooting
Many of our class periods listed in our course schedule are simply labelled as "Implementation & Team troubleshooting."

Why?

As already [mentioned](../ProjectProposal/README.md), we have two interconnected goals for the course: to have you develop more efficient research skills, and to have you make significant progress on your thesis work. Therefore, the start-of-quarter plan is to use these class periods to do just that by giving you time to implement what we're learning about to your own focal project.

Why "Team troubleshooting"?

Coding is very much a solo enterprise (most of the time).  Group-coding isn't fun (most of the time), and is not what we'll be doing (nor would it be possible given everyone's individualized projects).  But sharing tricks and short-cuts as specific (and hence more memorable) moments arise, talking through some pseudo-code with someone, and having a fresh pair of eyes look at your code to find that hiding bug...all those things happen more efficiently in an environment where it's okay, easy and encouraged to interact with others.

Depending on how things go (and by mutual agreement), we may move these classes around some, use them to make time for more elaborate discussions of certain topics, or even include additional topics in the quarter as your interests and needs become apparent.

### Class structure
Free form (for now)!

We'll see how this goes on Zoom (perhaps using break-out rooms for "louder" discussions).  If Zoom is too restrictive, we may decide to use [Discord](https://discord.com) where moving between "rooms" is easier.
