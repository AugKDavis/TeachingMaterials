- Git and GitHub are not the same!
	- Discuss what they are
- Using Git is extra-work, but the benefits are...


- Repo initializing using GitHub (rather than on local)
		- public/private
		- README
		- .gitignore
		- license
- Demonstrate cloning using:
	- GUI (SourceTree or GitHub Desktop) 
	- RStudio (create Project)
- Create R script (or edit README) to demonstrate:
	- Staging
	- Diffs
	- Commit
	- Push & Pull
- Editing .gitignore to deal with:
	- Discussion of large data files
		- Repo w/ non-Git out-of-directory folders (for big data)
	- Discussion of public/private combination
		- Repo w/ private nested repo (for manuscript or data)
- Start adding files (not all at once!  Use commits)
- Discuss student-specific issues
