# Intro & Philosophy
These days -- regardless of the research you're pursuing -- you're going to be using computers.  With computers come many choices in software (and, increasingly, user accounts).  This course will add several to your list, but at least two of them (Git and LaTeX) are in many ways much more of a tool in your toolbelt than just another app.
