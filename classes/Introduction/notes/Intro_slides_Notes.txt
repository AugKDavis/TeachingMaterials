Quick introductions - name, department, what you study. 
	Should we do 1 interesting fact about yourself??
	(Please call on next person by their name in the gallery view)

Any question that you're dying to ask?

Slideshow

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automation
	Bug, new data, many similar datasets, advisor/reviewer suggestions
	No use of manual drop-down menus/functions or user-input.

Reproducibility
	You will forget what you did and why you did it.
	Scientific issue (low reproducibility of experiments)
		Documentation & annotation
		Clean & readable code
		Straightforward & transparent project structure
		Minimal to no duplication (no file versions)
		Portable - everything in one place, no outside dependencies

Correctness
	Writing code for science, not code for software.
	Software can handle glitches/crashes and manages them, often through user-input.
	Your science should be mistake-free.
	Your code should do what it is intended to do, nothing else.
	Different codes should give the same result.

Simplicity
	Two-aspects:
		Readable code (clever vs. readable)
			Better to err on readable side
		Plain text files (csv and txt versus xls)
	
Openness
	Open science is better and more efficient science
	Free, open-source non-proprietary software
	Social-equity issue

Science as Software development
	Lots of coding
		There are tools and workflows to help
	Within-project automation and beyond
	Projects rarely truly end.  Their ideas almost never end.
	Should be able to reuse code for other projects 
		=> Version control
