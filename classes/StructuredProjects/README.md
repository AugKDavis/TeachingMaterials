# Structuring Projects

This class is about adopting a "project mindset" to organizing the folders and files associated with your research.

### Required readings (_before class_)
- Notes: [tex/StructuredProjects.pdf](tex/StructuredProjects.pdf)

### To do (_before class_)
_Nothing_ (but see [Version Control with Git and Github - Part 1](../VersionControl_Git_part_1/README.md))

### Class structure
- "Lecture" & discussion (_? min._)
- _~Break~_ (_5 min._)
- Self-analysis of your current practices (_~15 min._)
- (Re)starting your project's organization (_remaining time_)

After we're done, we'll move to [Version Control with Git and Github - Part 1](../VersionControl_Git_part_1/README.md).

### Further reading
- [Noble 2009. A quick guide to organizing computational biology projects](../../readings/pdfs/Noble2009.pdf) (offers a slightly different approach)
- [Marwick et al. 2018. Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly Using R (and Friends)](../../readings/pdfs/Marwick2018.pdf) (offers a completely-bundled approach)
