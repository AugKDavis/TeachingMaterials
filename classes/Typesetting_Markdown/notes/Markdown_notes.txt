Today: Dual purpose
	Learn basics of new typesetting language
	Add to reproducibility of your project

No lecture, just learning by implementation (as described on today's README)

Two sections
	1. Git-flavored markdown to create READMEs
		Home readme
		Data folder readme(s) — summary of data and meta-data
		Code folder readme — summary of workflow
		Results folder readme — summary of results
	2. R-flavored markdown
		Notebook or Report-writing (w/ code snippets)
