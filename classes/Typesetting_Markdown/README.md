# Typesetting with Markdown

There are a number of [Markdown flavours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).  Some people even use it to write and typeset their manuscripts (as we will learn to do with LaTeX).  We're only going to learn enough to:
1) write clear README files for our GitHub repositories, and
2) knit together code-integrated reports on analyses performed in R (for your digital notebook or your _annual_ committee meetings..._hint, hint!_).

### Required readings (_before class_)
- [Markdown in 3 minutes](https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/Learn-markdown-in-3-minutes)
- [R Markdown Quick tour](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html)


### To do (_before class_)
_Nothing_

### Class structure
- Create/format your GitHub READMEs (or data-folder meta-data files) using at least 4 of the elements summarized in [Markdown in 3 minutes](https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/Learn-markdown-in-3-minutes) (_40 min._)
- Create a barebones report using knitR in RStudio using [R Markdown Quick tour](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html) (_40 min._)
- Back to your choice of [Implementation & Team troubleshooting](../Implementation/README.md) (_remaining time_)
