# Typesetting in LaTeX
If you find yourself writing papers (or appendices) with more than a few equations, or are creating large or many tables, you're gonna love using LaTeX.  But there are many other reasons to use it too, especially when using Git to version-control your manuscripts.  In this class we'll learn the basics of using LaTeX to write and typeset manuscripts.

### To do (_before class_)
- Ensure you either have an account with an online tex editor or have installed a stand-alone editor (see [Introduction](../Introduction)).
