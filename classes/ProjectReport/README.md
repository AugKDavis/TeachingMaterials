# Project Progress Reports

The purpose of these mid-term progress reports is to help you (help each other) make progress on your projects.  More so than any [accountabilibuddy](https://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&d=1&t=6534), there's nothing like peer pressure to hold each other accountable!

### Required readings (_before class_)
_None_

### To do (_before class_)
- create a slide presentation (PowerPoint, Keynote, whatever) to present (_by sharing your screen_). _No more than **5 slides** (including title slide)!_

### Class structure
We'll dedicate the whole class period to presentations.

**Each presenter** will have **_6 minutes_** to:
1. summarize your project (i.e. the scientific issue being addresses);
2. summarize your proposed workflow;
3. summarize your goals for the quarter;
4. summarize your achieved successes to date;
5. summarize your main sticking points, failures, and anticipated challenges.

**Following each presentation there will be approximately 1 minute for comments from the group, while the next presenter is getting ready. Further feedback can be provided ad hoc during group discussions or outside of class. Acountibilibuddies will also provide each other feedback at the end of class, time allowing.**

### Rubric
The rubric with which your presentation will be assessed is [here](../../course_info/rubrics/).
