# Project Progress Reports

The primary purpose of these mid-term progress reports is to help you make progress on your project.  More so than a single [accountabilibuddy](https://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&d=1&t=6534), there's nothing like peer pressure to hold yourself (and each other) accountable!

The second purpose is to provide you with an opportunity to articulate/express what you are having trouble with in regards to implementing what the course is about; not your scientific stumbling blocks, but rather your stumbling blocks related to your workflow and project management.

The third purpose is to provide me wth insight into what you are all picking up from the class (and hence whether we should revisit some topics or add additional topics, etc.).

### Required readings (_before class_)
_None_

### To do (_before class_)
- Create a slide presentation (pdf, PowerPoint, Keynote, whatever) to present to the class. 
- Use _no more than **5 slides**_ (including the title slide)!
- Export slides to pdf.
- Send to Mark Novak (mark.novak@oregonstate.edu).

### Class structure
We'll dedicate the whole class period to presentations.

Each presenter will have **_6 minutes_** to:
1. summarize their proposed workflow;
2. summarize their goals for the quarter;
3. summarize their achieved successes to date;
4. illustrate/display their project structure;
5. summarize their main sticking points and anticipated challenges.

Try to
(1) _minimize_ the science to the bare minimum of necessary context (use only your title slide to _briefly_ remind us of your scientific topic), and
(2) _maximize_ insight into your implementation/progress with respect to your goals for the quarter (goals and hurdles in project management, workflow implementation, coding hygiene, etc.).


Following each presentation there will be approximately 1 minute for comments from the group while the next presenter is getting ready. Further feedback can be provided ad hoc during group discussions or outside of class. Acountibilibuddies will also provide feedback at the end of class, time allowing.

### Rubric
The rubric with which your presentation will be assessed is [here](../../course_info/rubrics/).
