# Project Progress Reports

The purpose of these mid-term progress reports is to help you (help each other) make progress on your projects.  More so than any [accountabilibuddy](https://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&d=1&t=6534), there's nothing like peer pressure to hold each other accountable!

### Required readings (_before class_)
_None_

### To do (_before class_)
- create a new _Issue_ on your GitHub repo page titled _Project report_.
- create a slide presentation (PowerPoint, Keynote, whatever) to present (_by sharing your screen_). _No more than **5 slides** (including title slide)!_

### Class structure
We'll dedicate the whole class period to presentations.

**Each presenter** will have **_6 minutes_** to:
1. summarize your project (i.e. the scientific issue being addresses);
2. summarize your proposed workflow;
3. summarize your goals for the quarter;
4. summarize your achieved successes to date;
5. summarize your main sticking points, failures, and anticipated challenges.

**All observers** must go to the presenter's GitHub repo and add to the _Progress report_ issue as a comment:
1. one (or more) compliments;
2. a suggestion, of any form (_optional_).

### Rubric
The rubric with which your presentation will be assessed is [here](../../course_info/rubrics/).
