# Project Summaries

This is it!  You did it!  The end of the quarter is here, so show us what you did!

### Required _before class_ readings
_None_

### To do _before class_
- create a new _Issue_ on your GitHub repo page titled _Project summary_.
- create a slide presentation (PowerPoint, Keynote, whatever) to present (_by sharing your screen_). _No more than **6-8 slides** (including title slide)!_

### Class structure
We'll dedicate the whole class period to presentations.  

**Each presenter** will have **_8 minutes_** to:
1. summarize your goals for the quarter;
2. summarize your achieved successes;
3. summarize your achieved scientific insights;
4. summarize your main sticking points and future plans.

**All observers** must go to the presenter's GitHub repo and add to the _Progress report_ issue as a comment:
1. one (or more) compliments;
2. a suggestion, of any form (_optional_).

### Rubric
The rubric with which your presentation will be assessed is [here](../../course_info/rubrics/).
