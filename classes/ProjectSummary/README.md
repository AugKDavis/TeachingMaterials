# Project Summaries

This is it!  You did it!  The end of the quarter is here, so show us what you did!

### Required readings (_before class_)
_None_

### To do (_before class_)
- create a slide presentation (PowerPoint, Keynote, whatever) to present (_by sharing your screen_). _No more than **6-8 slides** (including title slide)!_

### Class structure
We'll dedicate the whole class period to presentations.  

**Each presenter** will have **_8 minutes_** to:
1. summarize your goals for the quarter;
2. summarize your achieved successes;
3. summarize your achieved scientific insights;
4. summarize your main sticking points and future plans.

**Following each presentation there will be approximately 1 minute for comments from the group, while the next presenter is getting ready. Further feedback can be provided ad hoc during group discussions or outside of class. Acountibilibuddies will also provide each other feedback at the end of class, time allowing.**


### Rubric
The rubric with which your presentation will be assessed is [here](../../course_info/rubrics/).
