# Wrap-up reflection

It goes without saying that we appreciate any and all suggestions for improving this class the next time it's taught.  It _should_ also go without saying that you ought to be proud of what you've accomplished and learned this quarter, so let yourself (and everyone else) acknowledge that too!

### Required readings (_before class_)
_None_

### To do (_before class_)
Please come to class prepared to share and discuss with the class all that
- worked well for you
- didn't work for you
- you think we should do, or do differently, next time.

### Class structure
We'll use whatever time we have left after the final [Project Summary](../classes/ProjectSummary) presentations.
